    <h4>Song by Zach Bryan</h4>

    <p class="first">It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby
        These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
        But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
        I don't know much but there's no weight at all</p>
    <p class="sec">And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
        'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
        But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
        Something in the orange tells me we're not done</p>
    <p class="thrird">To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
        Where the hell am I supposed to go?
        I poisoned myself again
        Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home</p>
    <p class="fourth">I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
        There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
        Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
        Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak</p>
    <p class="fifth">To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
        Where the hell am I supposed to go?
        I poisoned myself again
        Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home</p>
    <p class="sixth">To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
        Where the hell am I supposed to go?
        I poisoned myself again
        Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home</p>
    <p class="seventh"> If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
        The orange touches all things around
        The grass, trees and dew, how I just hate you
        Please turn those headlights around
        Please turn those headlights around</p>
